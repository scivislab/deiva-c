\section{Static Simulation Configuration Data Requirements}\label{SimConstRequirementsSec}

Certain data is specified at simulation launch time; it remains static throughout the run.
This data may be required throughout the simulation.
It may include physical data, such as the domain extents, or
computational data, such as the starting time step, or the (static)
configuration of the run.
This data excludes things that change over the course of the simulation,
 such as current simulation time, or current mesh partition.
